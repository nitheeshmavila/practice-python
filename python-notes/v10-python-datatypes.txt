-------------------
->for getting the longest word , use the command
  wc -L combination with grep
->sed ,awk,head ,tail
->cron - a power unix utility
  used for scheduling job. scheduling a job at a particular time.s
-->lsb_release -a
    this command will show the ubuntu version and relese and codename
-->Md5 checksum:-
   md5sum filename
   it will generate the md5 checksum. use: to check the file is currupted or not-->swapon/swapoff
  to create swap files. to enable and disable swap.swap is actually a file in which if the ram is full you can shift some files to the swap file to execute some other programes.

python data types continues
------------------------------
-->In a staticalyy typed language the compiler has enough type information about to verify an operation is valid or not (eg in c)
but in a dynamically typed language like python , the compiler has no valid info of type to verify a operation is valid or not and type information is available only at run time!.

-->in the actual python implimentaion averything is written in c.
    for every object there is a structure (struct) in the source code and one of the field of the structure is the type!
--> when you write a=1 ,then                      [video time:35 min]
    its creating a variable of type structre 
    that is 
        struct pyobj {
          int type;
          ......
           ......
          }
                   
            
   a                        2000               [the address of the structre is 2000]
  ------               -------------
   2000                  type =INT            [INT is represented using a numerical value] 
                 
                          --------
                              1                 [storing actual value 1 ,it should have enough memmory to hold                                                       the value , 4BYTES]
                     
                
 that is the address of the structre is stored in a.

-->the key idea is ; python creates a box that box has a type field which indicates what type of object is stored in that box  , at run time this type information is used to check whether a particular operation is valid or not this is the trick used by almost all dynamically typed languages.
one of the reason behind the language is slow that of the multiple levels of pointer assignmnet

--------------------------
list
----
-->list slice operation using [:] , used to create copy of a list.
--> 'is' operator is used to check if the two variables are same at the memmory level.
--> id(variable) will return a unique number. unique represents that memory.
--> idea of list inside list

--> BASICALLY all variables  in python  are pointers.variables  get derefernced automatically.
