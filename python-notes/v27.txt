OO in python continues..

--> reference semantics involved in class and object.

--> if you just type the class name in interpreter it display the memory address of the class

--> you can assign class name to a variable then the variable is also pointing to the same memmory location that the class is.

-->unlike structure in C and class in C++ Python class is a  concrete entity not a abstract entity .

--> python class will occupy space in memory but the structre declaration in C will not consume any memory.

--> In C you can't pass a structure as an argument( but you can pass a structure variable) to a function but in Python you can pass a class as an argument to a function. and also return a class from a function.

-->In Python Classes are first class entity. it has its own memory representation. 

--> object representation in memory (12.00)
 Each object has a unique memory representation.

--> Can assign atributes to both classes and objects

--> The atribute is basically a pointer and a class is a container for atributes.
Memory rep at (21.00)

--> attribute search mechanism [26.00]

--> Class attribute and Object atributes
--> class attributes are like global variable
