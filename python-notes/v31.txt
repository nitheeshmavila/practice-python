-------------------

--> assertions
    ----------

assert statement

sanity checking in the code.
check a condition , there is no point proceeding further if the condition is false.

it is better to FAIL FAST.
---------------------

-->docstrings
first executable statement in side a function/class.

it is an atribute of that function

help(function_name)
function_name.__doc__

docstring need to explain what the function do and not how it works

------------------

-->doctest

 import doctest
 doctest.testmode()

it goes to all the function inside the source code and it check if there is usage  examples in the docstring at it actualluy invokes that function.

if the output is not correct it will show those things.

--> do not use doctest as a testing tool. use other modules like unittesting.
testing is always done in isolation.
