Scope cont...
-------------
-->
x = 1

def fun():
    x = 2
    print x

fun()
print x


op: 
2
1


local shadow glabals.


-->if you want to change a global variable inside a function use the keyword 'global'
eg
    global x

--> an assignment in python is more complex than in c.
         a=1
       this statement doing 2 things, creating a variable and assigning a value to it.
--> When you writing 'global x' what is happening is python will not create a new binding x it will instead store 10 in the globally visible variable.

--> from engineering prospective globals are bad idea



-->
x = 1

def fun():
    print x
    x = 10
    print x

fun()
print x


# the above code will show unboundLocalError
 python compiler will marks x as a local variable.
 when the python vm runs the code it sees x as a local variable and when it run print x (first print) there is no value for x.becasue compiler marked x as a local variable.
    here x is a kind of uninitialized local variable. For the virtual machine only way to terminate the programe is to generate a unboundLocalError

-->in python there is possible to have nested functions and so nested scope.





Functional Programing
----------------------

-->There are mainly 3 programing methodology/paradigms
1)imperative programing--C,assembly
2)object oriented---model the programe using classes and object -- objects will talk to each other by sending
  messages through methods.
3)functional programing--Lisp,scheme,haskell,ocaml
    "you are writing code as pure functions and immutable data"
     pure functions-->takes in some parameters,
     performs computaions,return values.there is no side effects(any thing which you can not define computationaly.)


"Python is a multi-paradigm language , it support all the above"
 "but predominantly imperative and obj oriented and support functional programing"
  python suuports fp to a certain limited extend

"in FP Functions are "first class"--you can manipulate functions almost like normal variables.

-->Two callable entity in python are functions and classes.

-->higher order functions: a function that manipulates functions( takes functions as arguments or return fn)

Map functions
-----------
takes a function and a list of values and apply the function to all values.
it will work on any iterable and dict.

-->ord()
    it returns the ascii value
prefer conprehension than map and filter


Filter()
---------
it will take a function and values and return a new list of values that the function returns True.

Reduce()
-------
taking a function and a list of values
in    reduce(f,[x1,x2,x3...,xn]) what is happening is f(f(f(x1,x2),x3).......,xn)

Map-reduce is made popular by google search algorithm.
hadoop is a open source framework for big data processing.



Anonymous functions or lambda
-----------------------------
function that does not have a name.
lambda x,y :x+y
f=lambda
f(2,3)

basic advantage is you can define a function in line.

lambda calculas ,alonzo church
