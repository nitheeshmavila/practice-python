Regular Expressions
-------------------
--> import re
--> re.search
--> ^ match at begining
--> $ match at end
--> row string -> r ( no special characters in row string)
--> .(dot) matches any single character
--> match object
--> matchobject.group()
--> +(one or more) and *(zero  or more)
--> pattern matching is greedy( it will try to match as much as possible)
--> no delayed gratification in pattern matching ( when it sees the first match it stops)
--> \d matches digits
--> grouping using () in patterns
--> re.findall --> find out all occurance of the pattern

--> Regular expressions are *very* tricky!

Use them with caution.

For very simple substring searching, don't use regexps, simply
use "find" method on strings.
