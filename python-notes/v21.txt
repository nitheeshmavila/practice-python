-->higher order functions- map, filter, reduce
-->lambda creates an anonymous functions.
-->sorted()
    It is a powerful function. it has an argument 'key' which is a function. what the sorted() function will do is that it apply 'key' (function) to every element in the sequence and the return values from the function are compared.

-->to sort a sequence of strings according to there lenght ,
    sorted(seq,key=lambda x : len(x))
    
    the above statement can be simplified by
    sorted(seq,key=len)
--> sorted(iterable, cmp=None, key=None, reverse=False) #structure

all the above are very important in functional programming.


closure [26.00]
-----------
closure is heavily used in functional programming.
