simple networking programming
-----------------------------
-->ip address
-->tcp/ip universal communication protocol
-->ipv4(total : 4 bytes , first 3 byte network id, last byte host id)
--> ipv6
--> class a/b/c
-->127.0.0.1 called loopback ip address (localhost) [ software interface]
--> ip address are assigned to network interfaces(like software interface, ethernet interface, wifi interface)
--> client - server programming
--> tcp/ip implimented as code in 'c' present in the os kernel. [only the application layer is outside the kernel]

--> A running on machine1, B running on machine2
    A has got to identify B by using two values , that is 
    IP address of machine2, port address/number
--> Ip address is used to identify machines 
    port number is a purely a logical quantity used to identify process.

--> http server port 80
    email on port 25
--> most of the tricky things involved in n/w is done by the protocol code within the kernel.
 
--> socket,bind,recvfrom,
