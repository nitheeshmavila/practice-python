---------------------
generators continues..
--------------------
for k in c: #where c is an generator object
    print k

this for loop is exactly equal to 
 while True:
    try:
        k = c.next()
    except StopIteration:
        break
    print k

--> close() method of generator object

--> you can't realy have a infinite datastructure

--> you can apply list() to a generator object.

--> you can use generators to aoid intermediate storage of data.
it has many applications in bigdata management.
