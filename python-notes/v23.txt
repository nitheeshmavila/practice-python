Shallow vs deep copying
---------------------- 
When doing deepcopy what python is doing is all the pointed to objects are duplicated in memory and this happen recursively.
there is a module called 'copy'

But when you doing a shallow copy a new copy of the pointed to objects is not created or the pointed to object are not duplicated. by default shallow copy.(eg list())
