--> functions -abstractions
--> Higher order functions - function which can pass arguments to functions
--> recursion
--> maximum recursion depth
--> Segmentation fault (core dumped) it is a low level error , generated by the os kernal
    any programe running in linux has a stack limit.
    
    ulimit -a
    stack size : 8129 (8 mb)
 when you call a function , it makes use of this stack to store its local variables and return address.
 when a function keeps calling it self recursively. it will consume all the stack space.
 if you set the recursion limit to a point and when the VM sees it has reached the limit vm will stop the programme. but in the previous case the python  vm is killed by the os keranl which is very dangerous. theese are two entirely different cases.

--> os level you can increse the stack size by `ulimit -s size`.
