list continues
--------------
--> [::-1] can be used to get reverse of a string
-->sort() is an in place sort.
-->sorted() will not change the original list.
--> in operator to check membership

--> list comprehensions
    to perform some repetative task in python
    first approch should be, can i  solve this using comprehesion if not think of 'for' loop , othe    r wise think of 'while'.
--> the idea of comprehension is a powerful one , it is very common in functional languages like haskell

--> list unpacking 

--> zip()
    it will take two list and combine and generate list of tuples.

Tuple
---------
The key difference beetween a tuple and list :  tuple is immutable where as a list is mutable.
eg: a=(1,2,3)
    type(a)
    tuple
  a=(1)
    type(a)
    int 
  a=(1,)
    type(a)
    tuple
-->get(key)
-->setdefaut(key,value) # if the key is not present it will add otherwise it will return the value of the key that is already in the dict.

-->dict comprehension
-->list unpacking
    using *
--> zip(*list)
