-----------------------
-->Python and all mnagaed languages(java,ruby etc) are memorsome contey safe.
  very small chance for memory leaks, even though there is safe abstractions it is possible to have memory problems.

--> Automatic memory management is mostly beneficial but in some context it will not work fine  in hard real time systems.
  (in control systems, robotics, industrial automation etc)

--> A very simple pointer assignment in python can trigger a chain of deallocations which can take variable amount of time, this will not happen in c.
  in python there is no guarante that the pointer assignment will take fixed amount of time.

--> computer graphics , games , animations etc in theese context 
  it become to hard to use a language with garbage collector.

--> algorithmic trading: in stock markets
    automating the trading using algorithms
    uses tuning java gc
-->  java platform is entrenched in enterprise market.

--> pygame --SDL-->libsdl

--> one way to speed up python is, find out where your code is getting slow and replace the code with c or c++
  using FFI(foriegn function interface) using with python code can call c/c++

-->scipy , numpy
    will work by interfacing to other languages like c/c++/fortran

pylint
---------
-->to find some trivial mistakes in your code, mistakes which are not dictected by the python VM.  checks for style issues.
 coding guidelines
 code become readable only if you using a consistent style
--> official style guide :PEP8

import
------
import statement is importing a new name space in your programe.

eg :
    import math
or another way to import is
     from math import * # but it is a very bad thing to do because it will introduce name clashes.

you ca use 
    import math as m # you can use if the module name is long

files
-----
#default mode of open is read
f=open('a.txt')
s= f.read()# will read the whole text as a single string. type(s) is string
s=f.readline()# it read only one line as a string. type(s) is string
s= f.readlines()# type(s) is list . s is a list of string(each line is a string)

"The open file handler is iteratable this is a key concept!!"
 you will get each line of the file in each iteration.
