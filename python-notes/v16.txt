memory manganement
------------------
--> in 'c' - manual memory management using 'malloc' and 'free'
-->when you say that a memory is freed that means that block of memory is available to allocate again.
--> garbage- the memory that is useless. you cant address that block of memory.
-->memory leak- you are allocated a block of memory and you lost the pointer to that memory block so that you cant free that memmory block, it become garbage. memmory leak  is very hard to detect
-->use after free bug in c
    meaning is that you cant acces a memory block that is already freed.
-->memory management in c is extreamly tricky and error prone.

Managed languages
----------------
In managed language, memory management is the responsiblity virtual machine.allocations and deallocation are done by vm. memory related bugs are less in managed languages.
