Exercise 6.8.
-------------
 The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides
both of them with no remainder.
One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when
a is divided by b, then gcd ( a, b ) = gcd ( b, r ) . As a base case, we can use gcd ( a, 0 ) = a.

Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their greatest common divisor.
