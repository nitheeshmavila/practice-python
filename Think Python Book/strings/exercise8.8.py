Exercise 8-8.
-------------
Read the documentation of the string methods at http://docs.python.org/lib/string-
methods.html. You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you
understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.

The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, the brackets in
find(sub[, start[, end]]) indicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but
start is optional, and if you include start , then end is optional'''
