Java is a set of computer software and specifications
 developed by Sun Microsystems,
 which was later acquired by the 
Oracle Corporation, that provides 
a system for developing
 application software and deploying
 it in a cross-platform 
computing environment. Java
 is used in a wide variety of 
computing platforms from
 embedded devices and mobile phones
 to enterprise servers and supercomputers. 
While they are less common than
 standalone Java applications,
 Java applets run in secure,
 sandboxed environments to provide many features 
of native applications and can be embedded in HTML pages.
