FreeBSD is a free Unix-like operating system
 descended from Research Unix via the Berkeley 
Software Distribution (BSD). Although for legal reasons FreeBSD
 cannot use the Unix trademark, 
it is a direct descendant of BSD,
 which was historically also called "BSD Unix" or
 "Berkeley Unix". The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993,
 and today FreeBSD is the most widely used open-source BSD distribution,
 accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed systems running open-source BSD derivatives.[2]
