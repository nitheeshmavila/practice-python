penBSD is a Unix-like computer operating system
 descended from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD),
 a Research Unix derivative developed at the University of California, Berkeley.
 In late 1995, Theo de Raadt forked it from NetBSD.
 Besides the operating system as a whole, the project maintains portable versions of many subsystems, most notably OpenSSH,
 which are available as packages in other operating systems.
