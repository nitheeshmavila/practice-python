Linux was originally developed as a free operating
 system for personal computers based on the Intel x86
 architecture, but has since been ported to more computer
 hardware platforms than any other operating system.
 Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones,
 Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.[20]
 Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as
 mainframe computers and virtually all fastest supercomputers,[21][22] but is used on only around 2.3% of desktop computers[23][24] when not including Chrome OS, which has about 5% of the overall and nearly 20% of the sub-$300 notebook sales.[25] Linux also runs on embedded systems, which are devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system;
 this includes smartphones and tablet computers running Android and other Linux derivatives,[26] TiVo and similar DVR devices, network routers, facility automation controls, televisions,[27][28] video game consoles and smartwatches.[29]
